# Contact App

## Problem Statement

There is a console version of the contact application, which provides the CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functionality. Each contact has 5 fields

1. firstName
2. lastName
3. company
4. email
5. phone

Implement the following functionality:

- Display a greeting screen and provide the Contact Application menu (as seen below).
- Select corresponding function according to the prompts. Allow for the data entry of necessary information to complete the selected operation.
- When the operation is completed, the program will return to the main page and allow
  - Selection of other menu options or
  - Exit the program.

Below is an example of the proposed greeting screen. The relevant option is executed by selecting the  corresponding number (1-5). You can exit the app by selecting number 6.

```
Contact Application
1. Create a contact      
2. Get a contact
3. Update a contact      
4. Delete a contact      
5. Retrieve all contacts 
6. Exit contact app      

Enter your choice (1-6): 
```

With code snippets provided, you need to complete the code of the following methods:

- createContact
- getContact
- updateContact
- deleteContact

# --------Steps to Solve the Problem------------

## Step1: Make sure you have Required Tools:

          Java 17 version installed with JAVA_HOME Path Variable
          
          VS Code IDE with Required Plugins for Java, GIT. 
                                    
          Git
          
## Step2: Accessing GITHUB Classroom and submiting Assignment


      Get the Link for GITHUB Classroom.
          
      Click and Authorize from your GITHUB account.
          
      Clone the Repository / open through VSCODE IDE. 
          
      Open contact-app --> src --> main --> ContactApp.java. 
          
      Solve the Problem Statements through code as detailed in Step 3 below.
          
      Commit the changes to the repositories, 
      labelling each commit numerically (Commit1, Commit2, etc.).
              
      Each commit will be tested automatically against the relevant testcases, 
      so you may need to submit several commits as you refine your solution. 
              
      Once you are finished with the assignment (either all test cases passed or not), 
      make sure to lable this commit as "final commit" (this may mean a previous commit passing and 
      you making a slight edit to the latter in order to mark the next commit as being final).
          
          
## Step3: Solving the Problem
